Lease manager for camera and heavy resources

- New: ResourceLeaseManager â€” provides exclusive (sequential) access to hardware resources via leases.
  - Adds optional timeouts: `createTimeout` and `releaseTimeout` to guard against hangs.
  - `releaseWaiting()` now completes after the resource is fully released and the lease is dequeued.
- Docs: Added detailed documentation for the lease manager and lease handle.
- Tests: Added unit tests for ResourceLeaseManager covering lifecycle, FIFO, timeouts, and queue limits.

Widget changes (FitatuBarcodeScannerPreview)
- API: constructor now expects `controllerLease: ResourceLease<FitatuBarcodeScannerController>` providing exclusive access to the camera controller.
- Internals: unifies Android/iOS previews behind a single widget; Android uses zxing, iOS uses `MobileScannerController` under the hood.
